  - text: "I was thinking about how I\u2019ve been doing all of this stuff by myself,
      and I think it\u2019s time I made a honest effort to work with others. I\u2019ve
      been working on creating these sorts of artsy cards that I can send to everyone
      in town. They explain my experience, and the steps I feel are necessary to
      protect Coral Cove, but everyone is also supposed to write their own thoughts
      and ideas and feedback and send them back to me. "
    responses:
    - text: So that way, everyone is included in the solution.

  - text: "Exactly! I was hoping I could even organize a sort of town hall, where
      we can have an open conversation about these issues. But we\u2019ll have to
      see how the cards go first. Here, why don\u2019t you take one? I\u2019ve got
      a lot more to make anyways. "
